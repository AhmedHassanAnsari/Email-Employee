# AI Employee for Email Automation

An autonomous "AI Employee" that monitors a Gmail inbox 24/7, drafts replies with a multi-agent AI pipeline, and **requires human approval before anything is sent**. Every completed task is written to disk and to Postgres as a full audit trail, and the human is kept in the loop via WhatsApp notifications.

> Agents never touch the outside world directly. Email read/search/send/label and WhatsApp delivery are exposed exclusively through **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** tools — that indirection is a hard design principle of this project.

## How it works

```
Incoming Gmail  ──►  Email Monitor (poll loop)
                         │  search unread via Gmail MCP, label "Processed"
                         ▼
                     Inbox/  +  emails row (status: pending)
                         │  POST /emails/{id}/solve
                         ▼
                  Multi-Agent Pipeline
                  Writer ─► Structure           (draft grounded in owner profile)
                         │
                         ▼
                     Approval/  (status: drafted)
                         │  WhatsApp: "reply awaiting approval"
                         ▼
              ┌──────── Human Review (web UI) ────────┐
              │                                       │
          Approve                                  Reject + feedback
              │                                       │
   send in-thread via Gmail MCP              Reviewer agent refines
   summarize ─► Done/ (status: sent)         ─► back to Approval/
   WhatsApp: "reply sent"                       (repeat until approved)
```

### Pipeline agents (Gemini via the OpenAI Agents SDK)

Gemini cannot combine **structured output and tool calls in one agent**, so the draft path is split:

| Agent | Tools | Output | Role |
|-------|-------|--------|------|
| **Writer** | Gmail MCP | free text | Reads thread context, drafts a reply grounded in the owner knowledge base |
| **Structure** | — | `StructuredReply` | Turns the free-text draft into `{subject, body, in_reply_to}` |
| **Reviewer** | — | free text | Refines a rejected draft from the user's feedback (stateless, context in-memory) |
| **Summarizer** | — | `SummaryOutput` | Writes the 2-3 line audit summary for `Done/` |

The Writer is constructed **per request** bound to the caller's Gmail MCP server (per-user bearer token). All agents share a model-fallback chain that walks through Gemini models when one hits its free-tier quota.

---

## Architecture

Three long-running services plus Postgres and an external Gmail MCP server:

- **`backend` (agent service)** — FastAPI app (`agent_service.main:app`) exposing the email lifecycle (`/solve`, `/approve`, `/reject`), our Google OAuth flow (`/oauth/google/*`), and the `GET /emails` view for the UI. Port `8001`.
- **`email-monitor`** — standalone poll loop (`email_monitor.py`). For each authorized user it searches Gmail for unread inbox mail, writes an `Inbox/{id}.json` artefact, applies a `Processed` label (restart-safe dedup), upserts an `emails` row, and triggers `/solve`.
- **`frontend`** — React + Vite + Tailwind dashboard with Inbox / Approval / Done views and an approve/reject-with-feedback flow. Served on `5173`.
- **`postgres`** — two app-owned tables: `emails` (the per-email state machine) and `google_tokens` (per-user Google refresh token, Fernet-encrypted at rest).
- **Gmail MCP** — [`taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp`](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp) run in **external-provider mode** over streamable-http. It is a pure resource server: it validates the `ya29.*` access tokens we mint and routes by the email in the token. **We own the OAuth consent flow and refresh tokens**, not the MCP server.

### Folder-based state machine

Emails flow through folders that represent workflow state (mirrored by the `emails.status` column):

```
Inbox/      newly fetched incoming emails       (status: pending)
Approval/   drafted replies awaiting review      (status: drafted)
Done/       sent replies + audit summary         (status: sent)
```

### Auth model

We run Google OAuth ourselves (`access_type=offline`, `prompt=consent`) and store each user's **refresh token** encrypted in Postgres. Per task we mint a fresh access token from it and hand that to the Gmail MCP as a per-request bearer. This survives MCP-server restarts and needs no re-consent.

| Agent framework | OpenAI Agents SDK (`openai-agents`) |
| LLM | Google Gemini (via the OpenAI-compatible endpoint) |

---

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose (easiest path), or Python 3.12 + `uv` and Node 18+ for local dev
- A Google Cloud OAuth client (Web application) with `http://localhost:8001/oauth/google/callback` as an authorized redirect URI
- A Gemini API key
- (Optional) Twilio WhatsApp sandbox credentials for notifications
- `uvx` available to run the Gmail MCP server (`taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp`)

### 1. Configure environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

- `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`
- `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI`
- `TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY` — generate a Fernet key:
  ```bash
  uv run python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
  ```
- `DATABASE_URL` (note the `+asyncpg` scheme)
- `GMAIL_MCP_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`)
- Twilio `account_sid` / `auth_token` / `from` / `to` (optional — notifications no-op if absent)

### 2. Start the Gmail MCP server

This runs separately from the compose stack (it needs `uvx`):

```bash
cd backend
bash scripts/run_workspace_mcp.sh   # streamable-http on :8000, external-provider mode
```

### 3a. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This starts Postgres, the agent service (runs `alembic upgrade head` on boot), the email monitor, and the frontend.

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Agent API: http://localhost:8001 (`GET /health`)

### 3b. Run locally without Docker

```bash
# Backend deps
cd backend
uv sync
uv run alembic upgrade head

# Agent service
uv run uvicorn agent_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001

# Email monitor (separate shell)
uv run python email_monitor.py

# Frontend (separate shell)
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 4. Connect a Gmail account

Open the frontend, sign in, and complete the Google consent flow (the backend redirects through `/oauth/google/start`). Once authorized, the monitor begins polling that inbox.

### 5. Add your own owner profile

The agent grounds every reply in an **owner knowledge base** — the `OWNER_PROFILE` string in `backend/agent_service/agent.py`. It ships as an empty placeholder so no personal data is committed to the repo. **You must fill it in with your own details** before the assistant can answer on your behalf.

Edit `OWNER_PROFILE` in `backend/agent_service/agent.py` and add sections such as: identity/background, current projects, availability and response policy, frequently asked questions, and any email-reply guidelines or agent rules you want enforced. The agent answers senders strictly from this text, so anything you leave out it will not know — and anything you put in **may be quoted to email recipients**, so never include passwords, credentials, or private data you would not send in an email.

> Treat this as configuration, not code. Keep your filled-in profile out of any public fork (e.g. via a local-only edit) if it contains details you would rather not publish.

## Key design principles

- **Human approval before every outgoing email** — nothing sends without an explicit approve action.
- **All external I/O through MCP tools** — agents never call Gmail or Twilio APIs directly.
- **We own auth** — Google refresh tokens are ours, encrypted in Postgres; the Gmail MCP is a stateless resource server.
- **Restart-safe** — the `Processed` Gmail label and Postgres dedup mean nothing is reprocessed across restarts.
- **Full auditability** — original email, draft history, feedback, final response, and delivery status are preserved in `Done/` and the database.

---

## Future enhancements

- **Observability through Langfuse** — instrument the multi-agent pipeline with [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) for end-to-end tracing, prompt/response logging, latency and token-cost metrics, and evaluation of draft quality across the Writer → Structure → Reviewer → Summarizer chain.
